* To start the program, run pyGames_FruitNinja.py

* Our team made (insert game title), a Fruit-Ninja-inspired-112-themed interactive game. In this game, the player has two goals: 1) save Pat and Mike from being devoured by the SCS
* dragon by flicking them away and 2) feeding meat to the dragon to ensure it does not get hangry. Using OpenCV, we implemented movement and color detection in order to detect a yellow
* rubber duck (or alternatively, a yellow caution sign), which the player holds and moves to flick away the humans.

* The user needs to install openCV, numpy, and pygame in order to run the game.
