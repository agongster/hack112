* To start the program, run Final_MeatDragon.py

Our team made Average 112 Midterm, a Fruit-Ninja-inspired-112-themed interactive game. In this game, the player has two goals: 1) save Pat and Mike from being devoured by the SCS dragon by flicking them away and 2) feeding meat to the dragon to ensure it does not get hangry, just like in an everyday 112 midterm. Using OpenCV, we implemented movement and color detection in order to detect a yellow rubber duck (or alternatively, a yellow caution sign), which the player holds and moves to flick away the humans. The player receives a final letter grade determined by the time elapsed before gameover.

* The user needs to install openCV, numpy, pillow, and pygame in order to run the game.
